# Dog-Repellent-Device
* The main purpose of our project is to develop a dog repellent device that ensures personal safety and provides a reliable solution for individuals encountering aggressive or unwanted dogs. By creating a portable and effective deterrent, it aims to offer peace of mind and protection in various situations.

* The dog repellent device will emit a harmless deterrent signal, combining high-frequency sound and non-harmful ultrasonic waves. The key objective is to discourage dogs from approaching while maintaining their well-being and avoiding any harm or discomfort.
